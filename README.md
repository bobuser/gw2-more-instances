# gw2-more-instances
Run more instances of gw2 at the same time

1. For this to work you need to create a seperate local Windows User account, for Guild Wars 2 to save your settings to. (aka. appdata Folder)
2. Place the .ps1 script in the root directory of your gw2.exe and download and place handle.exe from Sysinternals into the same dir.
3. Add your Local username and password to the credentials vars inside the script.
    * Edit the $username and $password vars.
    (You can also config the other variables inside the script.)
4. Run the script.  
Enjoy.
